Elloreas 1.18
1) Added an option "--stop_when_circular". It controls whether Elloreas should stop elongation when the contig becomes circular, i.e. when the 5' end of the contig is identical to the 3' end of the contig. Possible values: true or false. The default value is true.
2) Now pictures are made in .pdf instead of .jpeg
3) Now HiFi reads are aligned with the Minimap2 option "map-hifi" instead of "asm20". Since this option was absent in versions of Minimap prior to 2.19, Elloreas now requires Minimap 2.19 or newer.
4) Now the option "--draw_coverage_plots" creates coverage plots for the entire contig instead of the 3' end.
5) Several small changes.

Elloreas 1.17.
Minor changes in the description of the program.

Elloreas 1.16.
1) Minor changes slightly improving the accuracy of Elloreas.
2) Made the output of Elloreas a bit more readable.
3) Added a new option "--only_make_a_dot_plot_and_a_coverage_plot". If Elloreas is run with this option, it only produces a dot plot and a coverage plot for the starter, without extending it. This option is useful for understanding whether the starter contains assembly errors. 

Elloreas 1.15.
Improved the algorithm for reads with many sequencing errors.

Elloreas 1.14.
This is the first version of Elloreas deposited on GitHub.
