Elloreas 1.17.
Minor changes in the description of the program.

Elloreas 1.16.
1) Minor changes slightly improving the accuracy of Elloreas.
2) Made the output of Elloreas a bit more readable.
3) Added a new option "--only_make_a_dot_plot_and_a_coverage_plot". If Elloreas is run with this option, it only produces a dot plot and a coverage plot for the starter, without extending it. This option is useful for understanding whether the starter contains assembly errors. 

Elloreas 1.15.
Improved the algorithm for reads with many sequencing errors.

Elloreas 1.14.
This is the first version of Elloreas deposited on GitHub.
